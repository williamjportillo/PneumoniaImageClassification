# PneumoniaImageClassification
This project aims to improve pneumonia detection in children under five by analyzing chest X-ray images using ResNet50. Pneumonia is a leading cause of death, especially in low-resource areas. The system uses machine learning to provide accurate and affordable diagnoses, helping to reduce the reliance on expert radiologists.
